Vector and ArrayList are both classes in Java that implement the List interface and provide a resizeable array implementation of the List interface.
However, there are some key differences between them:
Synchronization: Vector is synchronized, meaning all its methods are thread-safe,
whereas ArrayList is not synchronized, meaning multiple threads can access and modify an ArrayList simultaneously, which can lead to data corruption.

Performance: Due to its synchronized nature, Vector is slower than ArrayList when accessing or modifying its elements.

To synchronize an ArrayList, you can use the Collections.synchronizedList method, which wraps an ArrayList in a synchronized wrapper. For example:

List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
List<String> synchronizedList = Collections.synchronizedList(list);
